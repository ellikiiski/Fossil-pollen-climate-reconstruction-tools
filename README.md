## Tools for fossil pollen based climate reconstructions

In this repository, you find the scripts used in the Master's thesis \[insert name here\] (2025) by Elli Kiiski from the University of Helsinki. The thesis itself is available \[insert link info here\].

#### Fossil pollen data processing

The fossil pollen data needs to be gathered and standardized to be compatible with the climate reconstruction models. Under the folder \[insert foder name\] you find the tools for the following.

- Fetch fossil pollen data from Neotoma database
- Filter the data based on chose criteria
- Harmonize the the data under given labels

#### Visualization and plotting

Both the fossil pollen proxy data and results from the climate reconstruction can be visualized in various ways. The folder \[insert foder name\] contains the following.

- Fossil pollen site maps
- Paleotemperature maps of the reconstructions
- Peleotemperature plots per reconstruciton model

#### PCA
